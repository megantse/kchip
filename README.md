- Find droplets from 5-channel images.
- Split the droplets by UV bin
- Save each the droplets in each bin separately to a csv file
- Import each csv file individually into the Interactive Clustering notebook and assign clusters
- Save csv’s from Interactive Clustering for each UV bin
- Bring those back into the Analysis notebook, concatenate them, and name the final DataFrame “droplets”
- Proceed with post-merge image analysis
- Do distance and area filtering
- Save the final DataFrame as a csv with the format: “YYYYMMDD_experimentName_trimmed_distance_and_area_filtered.csv”
